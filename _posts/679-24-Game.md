  ## [24 Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)
  
  You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators [&#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;*&#39;, &#39;/&#39;] and the parentheses &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39; to get the value 24.
  
  You are restricted with the following rules:
  
  	The division operator &#39;/&#39; represents real division, not integer division.
  
  		For example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.
  
  	Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use &#39;-&#39; as a unary operator.
  
  		For example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression &quot;-1 - 1 - 1 - 1&quot; is **not allowed**.
  
  	You cannot concatenate numbers together
  
  		For example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression &quot;12 + 12&quot; is not valid.
  
  Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.
  
  &nbsp;
  
  Example 1:
  
  ```
  
  **Input:** cards = [4,1,8,7]
  **Output:** true
  **Explanation:** (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
  
  ```
  
  Example 2:
  
  ```
  
  **Input:** cards = [1,2,1,2]
  **Output:** false
  
  ```
  
  &nbsp;
  
  **Constraints:**
  
  	cards.length == 4
  	1 &lt;= cards[i] &lt;= 9
